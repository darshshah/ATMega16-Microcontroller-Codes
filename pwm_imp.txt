1. PWM
	3 modes- we use fast or phase correct pwm
	so  set bits in WGM in tccr0

2.now acc. to WGM mode select COM00 and COM01 .it is diff for diff value of WGM.

3.OCR write the compare value.so our signal is on for 0 to COMPARE VALUE and then off from COMPARE VALUE to 255.
so by changing ocr1a or ocr1b value we generate pwm.

eg. OCR0 = 0xC0; //set 75% duty cycle
i.e. c0 corresponds to 192 in decimal. and 192/255 gives 75.2% so our duty cycle is 75%

similarly high value for ocr


When the PWM (PulseWidthModulation) mode is selected the
Timer/Counter 1 can be used as an 8,9 or 10bit, free running PWM.
Timer/Counter 1 acts as an up/down counter that is counting up from
$0000 to the selected top (8bit -> $00FF, 9bit -> $01FF, 10bit -> $03FF),
where it turns and counts down to $0000 and repeats this cycle
endlessly. When the counter value matches the content of the compare
register (OCR1A, OCR1B) it has an effect on the output pins OCA1 and
OCB1
